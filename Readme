Assignment:
Develop a Serverless application to Manage IAM users.
Backend Serverless Application:
- Use serverless framework(https://serverless.com/) to build the application.
(https://serverless.com/blog/flask-python-rest-api-serverless-lambda-dynamodb/)
- The backend code needs to be developed in Python.
- You will need to use AWS SDK to connect to AWS account and do IAM users related
operations. (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
- The data will be stored in DynamoDB table.
(https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/dynamodb.html)
- Deploy the application using CodePipeline auto trigger based on a comming in CodeCommit.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/tutorials-serverlessrepo-autopublish.html
Requirement:
- You will need to build 5 APIs
- Sync IAM users (This will get all the IAM users from the AWS account and add them to
dynamodb. Remove old users to avoid duplication.)
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html#user
- List IAM users (This will get all the IAM users from Dynamodb and return as json)
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.htm
l#DynamoDB.Client.scan
- Show single IAM user details (This will get 1 IAM user detail for which the details requested
from DynamoDB)
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.htm
l#DynamoDB.Client.query
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html#IAM.
Client.get_user
- Delete IAM user (This will delete the IAM user from DyanmoDB and do sync again)
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.htm
l#DynamoDB.Client.delete_item
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html#IAM.
Client.delete_user
- Create IAM user (This will create new IAM user in AWS account and do sync again)
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.htm
l#DynamoDB.Client.update_item
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html#IAM.
Client.create_user
